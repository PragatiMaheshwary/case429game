        'Flora Jasmine: He told me he was giving my share of his will to that good for nothing Dr. Sheppard for all the care she provide to Mrs. Ferris right before she died. I tried to reason with him but he was firm on his decision so I left the study and went outside to cool off. I walked the garden paths, called my friend Laila. She didn‚Äôt pick up, so I left her a voicemail.',

        'Flora Jasmine: I was furious. It wasn‚Äôt a threat‚Äîit was venting. He said awful things to me. Accused me of betrayal, said he was rewriting his will just to spite me. I was hurt and angry. But I didn‚Äôt kill him.',
        'DCI Langston: Why was he so upset with you?',
        'Flora Jasmine: Because I confronted him. I found out about the algorithmic bias in his company‚Äôs sentencing software. I had proof he knew about it and did nothing. He told me I was endangering his legacy‚Äîand my career.',
        'DCI Langston: When did you come back inside?',

        'Flora Jasmine: Yes.',
        'DCI Langston: No one saw you? No one can confirm that?',

        'DCI Langston: You understand that without an alibi, and considering your earlier threat, this doesn‚Äôt look good.',
        'Flora Jasmine: I know how it looks. But you‚Äôre focusing on what I said, not what I did. You‚Äôre ignoring why I was angry in the first place. If I were a man, would you be reading that voicemail the same way?',
        'DCI Langston: Let‚Äôs stick to the facts.',
        'Flora Jasmine: Then here‚Äôs a fact‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt kill him. The truth matters to me more than revenge.',
        'DCI Langston: In that case, did you know Mrs. Ferris left a note for Mr. Harpe which he likely read moments before his death? The contents of that letter led to his death Ms. Jasmine.',
        'Flora Jasmine: (hesitant) How can you be sure? What was in the letter?',
        'DCI Langston: That‚Äôs what we would like to know as well. What was the last conversation you had with Mrs. Ferris?',
        'Flora Jasmine: (hesitant) uhmm‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt recall anything specific. ',
        'DCI Langston: Are you sure you didn‚Äôt talk about any of this algorithmic stuff with Mrs. Ferris that she could have exposed or maybe your secret relationship with Dev, the butler?',
        'Flora Jasmine: (nervous and defensive) My relationship is my personal business, none of your or her business! And I didn‚Äôt have anything to hide that she could expose!! I was in my room the whole time like I said‚Ä¶now stop pestering me',
        'DCI Langston: We‚Äôll need to verify what you were reading and check any device activity if available.',
        'Flora Jasmine: Fine. I didn‚Äôt touch my phone, but my laptop was open. Check the browser history. I wasn‚Äôt hiding anything. I wanted to bring his secrets to light, not cover one up.',

        'Dr. Sheppard is a respected physician known for her precision and professionalism. Recently, however, her personal and professional life has been under strain. A malpractice suit concerning illegal testing of drugs has placed her under financial pressure, and her divorce settlement drained much of her savings. She is known to be meticulous, private, and extremely protective of her reputation.',
        'She has served as Eric Harpe‚Äôs personal physician for the past 13 years and was considered by some to be a close confidante. She was Harpe‚Äôs primary doctor, managed his medication for chronic hypertension, and supervised his treatment for recent anxiety symptoms. She also made good friends with Mrs. Ferris, according to the staff, and saw her much more regularly during the days before Mrs. Ferris‚Äô death. Another staff member also reported overhearing the two women bond over their ex-husbands and laughing about how Mrs. Ferris might have poisoned him.'
